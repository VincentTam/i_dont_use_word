# Introduction

Who am I?  This is an unnumbered list showing part of my answers.
Before that, I would like to see how a paragraph looks like in
pandoc's output.  I really hope that this paragraph is not too long.
Otherwise, I can do nothing to help.

- I'm a Linux user.
- I'm a free software supporter.
- I love text editing with Vim!

# Microsoft Word is *not* your friend!

- If you are satisfied by the current version of Word, how can
  Microsoft make money?
- You need to wait for a while for Word to load.
- It's possible that Word fails to process your file properly, due to:
  - Encoding error
  - Runtime error
  - Other errors

# Using plain text files

- Notepad seldom causes a computer to hang.
