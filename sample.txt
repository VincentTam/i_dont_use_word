# Introduction

Who am I?  This is an unnumbered list showing part of my answers.
Before that, I would like to see how a paragraph looks like in
pandoc's output.  I really hope that this paragraph is not too long.
Otherwise, I can do nothing to help.

- I'm a Linux user.
- I'm a free software supporter.
- I love text editing with Vim!

# Microsoft Word is *not* your friend!

- If you are satisfied by the current version of Word, how can
  Microsoft make money?
- You need to wait for a while for Word to load.
- It's possible that Word fails to process your file properly, due to:
	- Encoding error
	- Runtime error
	- Other errors

# Using plain text (TXT) files

- Notepad seldom causes a computer to hang.
- Notepad load files quickly.

Question: How about the font styles?

# Use markdown

1. It's simple to write.
2. You can create **bolded** and *italicized* fonts.
3. Editing without leaving the keyboard is efficient.
4. Finding and clicking the right buttons for a numbered list is slow.
5. Use pandoc to get a PDF file for your boss.

# Conclusion

- Microsoft Word
	- Inefficient
	- Susceptible to errors
	- Skills can be outdated after several years
	- Need to pay for the license
	- Need to pay for *another* license after several years

- TXT files and markdown
	- Easy to open
	- Easy to write
	- Pandoc to convert TXT files to a PDF file that has different
	  font styles.
